SECURE DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR VERIFYWIRE REGISTRY

⚠️  IMPORTANT: Never store private keys in files or commit them to version control.

RECOMMENDED: Use environment variables (see ../SECURE_DEPLOY.md)

SECURITY NOTE: Only use environment variables for private keys. Never pass them as command line arguments.

Deploy using environment variables only:

1. Fund your wallet:
   - Go to https://faucet.doma.xyz/
   - Connect your wallet
   - Request test tokens

2. Set your private key as an environment variable and deploy:
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url https://rpc-testnet.doma.xyz --broadcast --chain 97476

5. Update config after deployment:
   - Copy the deployed address from the deployment output
   - Update /assets/js/config.js
   - Update /contracts/deployments/doma-testnet.json

SECURITY NOTE: The quick-deploy.sh script only uses the private key in memory and does not store it anywhere.
